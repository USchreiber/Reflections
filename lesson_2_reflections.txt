What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initilize a git directory, git will create a hidden file called .git. I need it to start a working repositorry including commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is in the middle of working directory and repository so it is no directory but still not a repository. It is quite useful to choose which files you want to be in one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Even if there are changes to several file you can just add those files to the staging areae which you want to commit together. To check which files are in the staging area different to the working directory you can use git diff. To check the differences between staging area and the last commit you can use git diff --staged

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
pros automatic merging:
eindeutige Änderungen am Code werden automatisch übernommen > Zeitersparnis
for conflicts you always get a hint which line of code is not clear
you can easily merge two complete branches instead of only two commits.
cons automatic merging:
if the checking is not sensitive it may cause errors. Maybe one line is changed only in one version but is needed for another part of code wich is changed in the other version.
