What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initilize a git directory, git will create a hidden file called .git. I need it to start a working repositorry including commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is in the middle of working directory and repository so it is no directory but still not a repository. It is quite useful to choose which files you want to be in one commit.
